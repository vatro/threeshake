**Release canceled** (may be reconsidered) in favor of three-shaking with [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite)!
Even though this is working and might be usefull in certain scenarios, release has been canceled in favor of three-shaking with [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite). Please star / leave a comment if you would like to see it published as an npm package despite the fact it may be obsolete nowadays.


# threeshake
*Initial Motivation: faster generation of future [svelthree-three](https://github.com/vatro/svelthree-three) versions*

**Primary:** Make [three/examples](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/dev/examples) folder modules importable `... from 'three'` / treeshakable incl. all resolved dependencies and typings.

**Also cool:** Got used to having type definitions included in the three.js source? *threeshake* can bring them back / migrate them from [@types/three](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/tree/master/types/three).
